        "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to standardize and explain how different networking systems communicate with each other. It divides the complex process of communication into seven distinct layers, each with specific roles and responsibilities. The main purpose of the OSI model is to promote interoperability among different systems, provide a universal language for network communication, and simplify troubleshooting by allowing issues to be isolated at a specific layer. It also ensures that changes made in one layer do not impact others, making network design and maintenance more modular and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "The seven layers of the OSI model are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Physical Layer – This is the lowest layer and deals with the physical transmission of data through cables, switches, and signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Link Layer – It ensures error-free data transfer between two directly connected nodes using MAC addresses and protocols like Ethernet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Layer – This layer handles logical addressing and routing of data between devices on different networks using IP addresses and routers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transport Layer – It ensures reliable transmission of data through mechanisms like error checking, flow control, and protocols like TCP and UDP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Session Layer – This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections (or sessions) between applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presentation Layer – It translates data between the application and network formats and is responsible for encryption, compression, and translation (e.g., SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG formatting).\n",
        "\n",
        "Application Layer – The topmost layer interacts directly with end-user applications such as web browsers and email clients, using protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when you visit a website, the application layer handles your HTTP request, the transport layer uses TCP to ensure data is delivered reliably, the network layer routes the data via IP, and finally, the physical layer sends it as electrical signals. In summary, the OSI model helps in standardizing communication, improving network design, and simplifying problem-solving across different network systems."

        "The TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a foundational communication protocol suite that defines how data is transmitted over the internet and other computer networks. Its primary purpose is to provide a standardized framework for network communication, ensuring that different types of devices and systems can communicate reliably, regardless of their internal architecture or operating systems. The importance of the TCP/IP model lies in its practical implementation and global adoption, as it forms the backbone of the modern internet. Unlike the OSI model, which is more theoretical, the TCP/IP model is used directly in real-world networking.\n",

This layer handles high-level protocols, data formatting, and user interface interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transport Layer: This layer ensures end-to-end communication, error checking, and reliable data delivery between hosts. The two main protocols used are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides reliable and ordered delivery, and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which is faster but does not guarantee delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "Internet Layer: This layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing of data packets across different networks.
